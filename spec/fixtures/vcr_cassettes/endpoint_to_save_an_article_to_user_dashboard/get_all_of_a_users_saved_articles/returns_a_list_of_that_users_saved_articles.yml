        To examine changes in viral suppression status among HIV patients receiving

        care visits. METHODS: Using data reported to the National HIV Surveillance
        System from 33 jurisdictions with complete reporting of CD4 and viral load
        tests, we created four viral suppression status groups based on their first
        and last viral loads in 2014: both suppressed, first unsuppressed and last
        suppressed (improved), first suppressed and last unsuppressed (worsened),
        and both unsuppressed. We also calculated the number and percentage of persons
        whose sole viral load in 2014 was suppressed and had a suppressed viral load
        at their last test in 2013. RESULTS: Among 339515 persons with at least two
        viral load tests in 2014, 72.6% had all viral loads suppressed (durably suppressed);
        75.5% had the first and last tests suppressed, 10.5% improved, 4.2% worsened,
        and 9.9% had both unsuppressed. Among 92309 persons who had only one viral

        National surveillance data show that the majority of patients in HIV care
        during 2014 were durably suppressed. More showed improved compared to worsened
        viral suppression status. Some patients who have less frequent care visits
        have sustained viral suppression. Yet one in ten who were in regular care
        did not have a suppressed viral load in 2014, indicating missed opportunities
        for clinical interventions to help patients achieve and sustain viral suppression.","notes":"1473-5571:Crepaz,
