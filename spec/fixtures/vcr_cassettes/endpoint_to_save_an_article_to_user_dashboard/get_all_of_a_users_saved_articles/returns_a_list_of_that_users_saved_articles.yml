        To examine changes in viral suppression status among HIV patients receiving
        care in 2014 and the extent of viral suppression among persons with infrequent
        care visits. METHODS: Using data reported to the National HIV Surveillance
        System from 33 jurisdictions with complete reporting of CD4 and viral load
        tests, we created four viral suppression status groups based on their first
        and last viral loads in 2014: both suppressed, first unsuppressed and last
        suppressed (improved), first suppressed and last unsuppressed (worsened),
        and both unsuppressed. We also calculated the number and percentage of persons
        whose sole viral load in 2014 was suppressed and had a suppressed viral load
        at their last test in 2013. RESULTS: Among 339515 persons with at least two
        viral load tests in 2014, 72.6% had all viral loads suppressed (durably suppressed);
        75.5% had the first and last tests suppressed, 10.5% improved, 4.2% worsened,
        and 9.9% had both unsuppressed. Among 92309 persons who had only one viral
        load test in 2014, 69960 (75.8%) were suppressed and, of those, 53834 (76.9%)
        also had a suppressed viral load at their last test in 2013. CONCLUSIONS:
        National surveillance data show that the majority of patients in HIV care
        during 2014 were durably suppressed. More showed improved compared to worsened
        viral suppression status. Some patients who have less frequent care visits
        have sustained viral suppression. Yet one in ten who were in regular care
        did not have a suppressed viral load in 2014, indicating missed opportunities
        for clinical interventions to help patients achieve and sustain viral suppression.","notes":"1473-5571:Crepaz,

        retention of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in the HIV care and treatment
        cascade is essential to guide program strategy and evaluate progress toward
        globally-endorsed 90-90-90 targets (i.e., 90% of PLHIV diagnosed, 81% on sustained
        antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 73% virally suppressed). We describe national
        retention from diagnosis throughout the cascade for patients receiving HIV
        services in Haiti during 1985-2015, with a focus on those receiving HIV services
        during 2008-2015. Among the 266,256 newly diagnosed PLHIV during 1985-2015,
        49% were linked-to-care, 30% started ART, and 18% were retained on ART by
        the time of database closure. Similarly, among the 192,187 newly diagnosed
        HIV-positive patients during 2008-2015, 50% were linked to care, 31% started
        ART, and 19% were retained on ART by the time of database closure. Most patients
        (90-92%) at all cascade steps were adults (>/= 15 years old), among whom the
        majority (60-61%) were female. During 2008-2015, outcomes varied significantly
        across 42 administrative districts (arrondissements) of residence; cumulative
        linkage-to-care ranged from 23% to 69%, cumulative ART initiation among care
        enrollees ranged from 2% to 80%, and cumulative ART retention among ART enrollees
        ranged from 30% to 88%. Compared with adults, children had lower cumulative
        incidence of ART initiation among care enrollees (64% versus 47%) and lower
        cumulative retention among ART enrollees (64% versus 50%). Cumulative linkage-to-care
        was low and should be prioritized for improvement. Variations in outcomes
        by arrondissement and between adults and children require further investigation
        and programmatic response.","notes":"1476-1645:Auld, Andrew F:Valerie Pelletier:Robin,
