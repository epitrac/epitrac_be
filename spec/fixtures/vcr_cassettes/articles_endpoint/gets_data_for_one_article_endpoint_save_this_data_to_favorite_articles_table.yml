        (PA) is a component of anthrax toxin that can elicit toxin-neutralizing antibody
        responses. PA is also the major antigen in the current vaccine to prevent
        anthrax, but stability problems with recombinant proteins have complicated
        the development of new vaccines containing recombinant PA. The relationship
        between antigen physical stability and immunogenicity is poorly understood,
        but there are theoretical reasons to think that this parameter can affect
        immune responses. We investigated the immunogenicity of anthrax PA, in the
        presence and absence of the soluble von Willebrand factor A domain of the
        human form of receptor capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (sCMG2), to elicit
        antibodies to PA in BALB/c mice. Prior studies showed that sCMG2 stabilizes
        the 83-kDa PA structure to pH, chemical denaturants, temperature, and proteolysis
        and slows the hydrogen-deuterium exchange rate of histidine residues far from
        the binding interface. In contrast to a vaccine containing PA without adjuvant,
        we found that mice immunized with PA in stable complex with sCMG2 showed markedly
        reduced antibody responses to PA, including toxin-neutralizing antibodies
        and antibodies to domain 4, which correlated with fewer toxin-neutralizing
        antibodies. In contrast, mice immunized with PA in concert with a nonbinding
        mutant of sCMG2 (D50A) showed anti-PA antibody responses similar to those
        observed with PA alone. Our results suggest that addition of sCMG2 to a PA
        vaccine formulation is likely to result in a significantly diminished immune
        response, but we discuss the multitude of factors that could contribute to
        reduced immunogenicity.IMPORTANCE The anthrax toxin PA is the major immunogen
        in the current anthrax vaccine (anthrax vaccine adsorbed). Improving the anthrax
        vaccine for avoidance of a cold chain necessitates improvements in the thermodynamic
        stability of PA. We address how stabilizing PA using sCMG2 affects PA immunogenicity
        in BALB/c mice. Although the stability of PA is increased by binding to sCMG2,
        PA immunogenicity is decreased. This study emphasizes that, while binding
        of a ligand retains or improves conformational stability without affecting
        the native sequence, epitope recognition or processing may be affected, abrogating
        an effective immune response.","notes":"2379-5042:de Oliveira, Fabiana Freire
